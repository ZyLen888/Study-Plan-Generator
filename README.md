# Study Plan Generator

Inspired by the official OpenAI Project: [OpenAI API quickstart](https://github.com/openai/openai-quickstart-node) 

## üß† Thought
I always wondered about how would someone start to learn about a topic of their interest? What is their plan? 
Can I grasp an overview or an idea about a topic within 7 days? 
With this mindset, I embark on the journey of building a tool for this goal: Generate a study plan to help people learn ANYTHING in a week!

## üí™ Action
Leveraging the powerful OpenAI, creating a comprehensive study plan based on a topic of interest will be easier than ever! 

## üõ†  Technologies
The front end is built with React, and the back end is built with Node.js and Express.

## üõ£ Future Plan
**This is a project in progress**, starting with a simple interface similar to the official project, I will continue to add more features to it with the progression of advancing my React, and Node.js skills! 

**Plan**
- Deploy freely online for people to use!
- Format the generated plan better visually 

## üëÄ See this in action 

üí∞ Deployment will cost some money, as well as I had a concern about my OpenAI API being abused, so before I found a platform to deploy for FREE, if you want to see this application in ACTION, please follow the steps below.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the root directory.
2. There are two folders in the root directory: client and server. Each folder has its own package.json file and node_modules folder.

**Please retrieve your own OpenAI API to install in .env file**

### Installing Dependencies

To install the dependencies for the client, navigate to the client folder and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

To install the dependencies for the server, navigate to the server folder and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Running the Client

To run the client, navigate to the client folder and run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

The client will be available at http://localhost:3002/.

### Running the Server

To run the server, navigate to the server folder and run the following command:

```
npm start
```
