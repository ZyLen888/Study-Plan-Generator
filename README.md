# Study Plan Generator

Inspired by the official OpenAI Project: [OpenAI API quickstart](https://github.com/openai/openai-quickstart-node) 

## ðŸ§  Thought
I always wondered about how would someone start to learn about a topic of their interest? What is their plan? 

## ðŸ’ª Action
Leveraging the powerful OpenAI, it will be easier than ever to create an comprehensive study plan based on a topic of interest! 

## ðŸ›   Technologies
The front end is built with React, and the back end is built with Node.js and Express.

## ðŸ›£ Future Plan
**This is a project in progress**, starting off with a simple interface similar to the official project, I will continue to add more features to it with the progression of advancing my React, Node.js skills!

### Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the root directory. There are two folders in the root directory: client and server. Each folder has its own package.json file and node_modules folder.

### Installing Dependencies

To install the dependencies for the client, navigate to the client folder and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

To install the dependencies for the server, navigate to the server folder and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Running the Client

To run the client, navigate to the client folder and run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

The client will be available at http://localhost:3002/.

### Running the Server

To run the server, navigate to the server folder and run the following command:
